- pole gry + (game field with cards)
- licznik prób + (You have clicked X cards)/(You have won X times)
- licznik sukcesu + (You have found X out of Y pairs)
- lista znalezionych obrazków + (Founded pairs table)
- reset button + (Reset Game || Delete cards, Shuffle, Start new set) -> (2 ways of reseting games)
- licznik czasu(dodatkowo) + ( It is kind of lame counter but to be honest no one told what exactlly shoud be counted.)
- komunikacja z użytkownikiem(dodatkowo) - ( player can play with slider but can't change number of cards in a game (quantity variable (responsible for handling number of cards) shoud have a subscription mechanism or global state controller)
programmer can manual change value of 'quantity' variable to change number of card pairs. Max number of pairs is 12(see numberOfColors function in main.js for more info)

Things that shoud be improved:
- Modules: Allfuncionalities are  in huge monolitic main.js
- Core functionality: Player can start to click cards before their are covered. Player can click already discovered pairs. Player don't know which card was clicked last time what can lead to a frustration.
- Mutability: Quantity of mutability in this code woud make Darwin proud. Myself - not somuch. 0 design patterns. No observables, 0 state controll mechanism. No
- Unit tests...
